# ðŸ§‹ MoMoCha Website

Hello! This is a responsive landing page I built for the bubble tea cafÃ© MoMoCha in 202, using React. The goal was to: 

- Capture the cute and playful atmosphere of the cafÃ©
- Make the menu visually appealing
- Make relevant information easily accessible for customers

## ðŸ’» Setup
To run this project locally:\
`yarn install`\
`yarn start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
